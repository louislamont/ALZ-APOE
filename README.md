### APOE4 expression in cerebral organoids

APOE E4 variant is a major genetic risk allele for Alzheimer's disease.

APOE E3 variant is the most common in caucasian populations.

Here, is an analysis of RNA sequencing data from two lines of cerebral organoids derived from iPSCs. One line is homozygous for the E3 variant and one for the E4 variant.

RNA-seq data were downloaded from GEO, accession GSE117588. Thank you to the authors for making their data available.
