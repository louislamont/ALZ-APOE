### APOE4 expression in cerebral organoids

APOE E4 variant is a major genetic risk allele for Alzheimer's disease.

APOE E3 variant is the most common in caucasian populations.

Here, we have sequencing from 3 samples of neural cells containing the E4 variant, and 3 samples of neural cells where the E4 variant has been edited to the E3 variant.

Comparison of APOE E4 vs E3 isogenic organoids with 3 biological replicates per group.

RNA-seq data were downloaded from GEO, accession GSE117588. Thank you to the authors for making their data available.
